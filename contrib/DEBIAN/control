Description: Davinci - A tool to manipulate and view various types of data, developed in Mars Space Flight Facility
         Davinci is an interpreted language that looks and feels a lot like C,
         but has additional vector oriented features that make working with blocks
         of data a lot easier. This makes davinci well suited for use as a data
         processing tool, allowing symbolic and mathematical manipulation of
         hyperspectral data for imaging spectroscopy applications.  See http://davinci.mars.asu.edu for more details.
