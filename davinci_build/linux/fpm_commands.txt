I used this process and fpm command to create rpm files but similar would work
for any Unix OS or package type, see fpm help

You can get and read about fpm here:
https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm

Also note, if you're using this on CentOS/RHEL, they use such outdated
packages, their default ruby version is too old for fpm to work.  You have
to install and enable the SCLs before you run the fpm command, ie

(after it's installed):
scl enable rh-ruby22 bash

./configure --prefix=/usr
make install DESTDIR=/home/rswinkle/testinstall/
cd ~

--description \
"Davinci is an interpreted language that looks and feels a lot like C, \
but has additional vector oriented features that make working with blocks \
of data a lot easier. This makes davinci well suited for use as a data \
processing tool, allowing symbolic and mathematical manipulation \
of hyperspectral data for imaging spectroscopy applications."
