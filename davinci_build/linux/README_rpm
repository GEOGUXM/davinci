Davinci RPM builder. 

(For more information visit: http://davinci.asu.edu/index.php/Compiling_Davinci)

The directory (build_utils) of build_rpm.sh script must be located in the main davinci source directory. 
For example the directory structure looks like.

davinci_source
davinci_source/build_utils
davinci_source/build_utils/build_rpm.sh

Get in the build_utils directory and run the ./build_rpm.sh script.
After the building process the i386.rpm and src.rpm files are created and copied onto the build_utils
directory.
