    The BOL table contains the raw and calibrated visual and thermal 
    bolometer measurements, and several properties derived from these
    measurements.

    Six BOL records are generated for each instrument scan, one for
    each detector.  When spectrometer data are temporally averaged, 
    there can be up to 4 scans of bolometer data."
