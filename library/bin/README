To have command line scripts be platform independant:

1) The first 2 lines must be:
#!/mars/common/bin/davinci -fq -v0
source("/themis/lib/dav_lib/library/library.dvrc")

These lines will be removed and updated on the user
calling davinci's library_update(update=1,beta=1)

2) The files must have the extension ".dv"

3) Must not rely on any (or any significant) external scripts/commands
	NOTE: these can be included in the $SCRIPT_FILES directory
